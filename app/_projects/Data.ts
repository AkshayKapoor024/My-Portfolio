        overview:
            "CodeArena is a high-performance real-time competitive programming platform designed to transform traditional coding practice into an intense head-to-head experience. Built on a MERN architecture with WebSocket-driven matchmaking, it enables developers to compete in live algorithmic duels with synchronized progress tracking, instant test-case validation, and dynamic rating updates. The system integrates AI-powered search and complexity analysis, providing users with intelligent feedback on their solutions while maintaining secure authentication and scalable match lifecycle management.",

        problem:
            "Most competitive coding platforms are static and asynchronous, lacking real-time head-to-head environments. Developers often struggle to receive immediate feedback on performance, efficiency, and time complexity while competing in a live setting.",
